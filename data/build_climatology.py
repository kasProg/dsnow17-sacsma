"""Builds a monthly-climatology sequence per basin -- the LSTM's dynamic
input, alongside the static attribute matrix from build_attributes.py.

Why climatology instead of feeding the raw daily training-window series
through the LSTM: the training window (WY1991-1993, see src/train.py) is
only 3 years, chosen for coupled-pipeline runtime, not because it's a
representative climatological sample. Computing monthly means from each
basin's FULL available record (up to 35 years) gives a genuine seasonal
signal -- when does precip peak, how cold do winters get, how much does
PET vary through the year -- that's independent of which 3-year window
later gets used for the actual differentiable rollout, and is a much
shorter, more robust sequence (12 steps) than a raw multi-year daily
series would be for an LSTM trained on only 35 basins.

z-score normalized (features: prcp, tmean, pet), mean (3,), std (3,).
