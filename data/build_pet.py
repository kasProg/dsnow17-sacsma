"""Precomputes and caches Hargreaves PET for every selected basin's full
forcing record, writing data/camels/pet/{gauge_id}_pet.csv.

Run this before build_climatology.py/src/train.py so a training run
reads PET from the cache rather than triggering computation implicitly
the first time each basin's data is touched -- camels_loader.get_pet()
falls back to computing+caching on first access regardless (this script
just makes that step explicit and up front, and lets the cached values
be inspected/reviewed as their own artifact rather than only living
inside whatever consumes them).
