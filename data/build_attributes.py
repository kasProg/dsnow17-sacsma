"""Build the static basin-attribute feature matrix for the selected
basins (data/select_basins.py must run first).

Uses every numeric column across CAMELS' five attribute files (climate
indices, topography, soil, vegetation, geology) -- 39 features total,
not a hand-picked subset matching any particular paper's exact list.
Categorical columns (dom_land_cover, geol_1st_class, etc.) are dropped
rather than one-hot encoded -- reasonable scope for a static attribute
set this small, not a claim that they're uninformative.

Missing values (a handful of basins are missing root_depth_50/99 or
geol_porostiy) are median-imputed using the FULL 671-basin distribution,
not just our 45-basin subset -- more stable than a 45-sample median,
and the "typical" value across all CAMELS basins is still a reasonable
default for the handful of gaps within our selection.

Writes data/camels/basin_attributes.npz: gauge_ids (45,), feature_names
(39,), X (45, 39) z-score normalized, mean (39,), std (39,) -- the last
two saved so a basin can be featurized identically at inference time.
